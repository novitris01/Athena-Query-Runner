# Athena-Query-Runner
The Athena Query Runner is a Python script that enables you to execute SQL queries in AWS Athena, a serverless interactive query service. This script reads SQL files, splits them into individual queries, and submits them to Athena for execution. It handles query execution, status polling, and tracks the number of successful queries.
